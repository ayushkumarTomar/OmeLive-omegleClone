# OmeLive - A p2p based Omegle Clone

## Overview

OMELIVE is a real-time, peer-to-peer (P2P) video chat application inspired by Omegle. It enables anonymous video chat sessions between users. OmeLive uses WebRTC technology to establish direct video and audio connections between users, minimizing latency and ensuring secure communication. The application relies on a signaling server for the initial connection setup.
## STUN AND TURN SERVERS
For OmeLive to function effectively, especially behind restrictive NATs or firewalls, you need to include your own STUN and TURN servers. These servers assist in establishing and maintaining the peer-to-peer connections.
### Purpose
- **STUN Servers**: Help discover public IPs and ports for establishing direct peer-to-peer connections.
- **TURN Servers**: Relay media when direct connections are blocked or unreliable.

**Note**: Configure your own STUN and TURN servers for optimal performance and security.

### Configuration
1. **Obtain Server Information**: Use public servers for testing or set up your own for production. You can get one free from [here](https://www.metered.ca/stun-turn)
2. **Integrate Servers**: Update WebRTC configuration in your application in config/config.ts.
   ```javascript
   const configuration = {
     iceServers: [
       { urls: 'stun:stun.example.org' },
       {
         urls: 'turn:turn.example.org',
         username: 'yourUsername',
         credential: 'yourPassword'
       }
     ]
   };
   ```
3. **Test the Configuration**: Ensure connections are stable in various network environments.

## Features

- **Real-Time Video Calling**: High-quality, video and audio communication. 
- **Peer-to-Peer Connection**: Direct communication using WebRTC for low-latency, secure video chats.
- **Anonymous Matching**: Random pairing of users for spontaneous video conversations.
- **Real-Time Chatbox**: Users can chat also during video meets.
- **Anonymity**: Server doesnt persist any storage of your chats or history

## Technologies Used

- **WebRTC** : WebRTC: Enables peer-to-peer video and audio exchange for real-time video calling.
- **Socket.IO**: For transferring messages and SDP offers
- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
